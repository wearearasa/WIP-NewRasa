      <h2>How It All Started</h2>
      <p>
        It was late 2015. My first son was 4 months old, and the sleepless nights were wearing me thin. I was desperate for a solution, but knew that coffee hurt my belly, made me feel acidic, AND contributed to anxiety and sleeplessness.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I searched for something that would help me cope with the stress of motherhood and life, while nourishing my body.  I tried every coffee alternative I could get my hands on, but nothing hit the spot. Some coffee alternatives were healthy, but tasted gross.     
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Some had cacao, which actually has caffeine. I wanted a fully caffeine-free option.</li>
        <li>Some were caffeine-free, but had ‚Äúnatural flavors.‚Äù No thanks.</li>
        <li>And some tasted good and were caffeine free, but weren't packed with the health benefits I was seeking.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>I knew we could do WAY better than this, and decided to create a delicious coffee alternative.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p style="position: relative;">
        A herbalist friend of mine and I got together and crafted a dark, rich, and roasty coffee alternative, loaded with adaptogens. We tested our herbal coffee on some coffee-lovers at a Thanksgiving dinner‚Äîthey were in love! And so Rasa Koffee was born.<br> <span class="heart"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="19" viewBox="0 0 20 19">
