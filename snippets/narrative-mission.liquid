We believe in sourcing energy from within, and adaptogens are Natureâ€™s key to sustained, balanced energy all day long.

Coffee is great, but itâ€™s an external source of energy that is  taxing to your adrenals and nervous system in the long run. Our cultureâ€™s #1 support tool for a worn-out life takes from us, too. Thatâ€™s why we set out to create an alternative that  energizes AND nourishes.

You can still have your coffee with Rasa! Or with cacaoâ€¦or in an adaptogenic latte. However it fits into YOUR life. Youâ€™ll feel energized & nourished, not one or the other!
